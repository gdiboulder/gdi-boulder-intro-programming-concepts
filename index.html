            <h3>What is a Computer Program?</h3>
            <p class="box">At its core, a computer program is<br /><strong>a way of getting something done</strong>.</p>
            <ul class="copy--small list--tall">
                <li>One of the ways to accomplish "getting something done" is a list of instructions that tells the computer exactly what to do and allows interaction with human beings.</li>
                <li>Those instructions have to be written in a "language" that the computer can understand.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Programming Languages</h3>
            <p class="box copy--small">A programming language is, basically, a set of strings (letters, numbers, commands) that are turned into machine code that the computer can understand.</p>
            <div>
                <p class="copy--xsmall">The language you use for a program depends on a number of things:</p>
                <ul class="list--tall copy--xsmall box--small">
                    <li>How the program will be used.</li>
                    <li>What you want the program to do.</li>
                    <li>What languages you know.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Programming Languages</h3>
            <p class="box--small">For example:</p>
            <ul class="list--tall copy--small">
                <li>To develop websites, you might use <strong>HTML, JavaScript, Python, Java, PHP</strong>.</li>
                <li>To create databases and move information in and out of them, you might use <strong>MySQL, SQL, Dbase</strong>.</li>
                <li>To write applications like Microsoft Word or Adobe Acrobat, you might use <strong>C#, Java, Visual Basic</strong></li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Programming Languages</h3>
            <ul class="copy--small list--tall box--small">
                <li>Computers don’t exactly understand programming languages (such as Java or Python). They need to be transformed into the computer language that they can understand.</li>
                <li>
                    That computer language is strings of 1’s and 0’s-- binary numbers that most people can’t read easily-- to be able to do anything with them.
                    <ul class="copy--small">
                        <li>For example, the letter 'A' in a computer has the binary representation: 01000001.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Despite being able to decipher those unintelligible strings of 1’s and 0’s, computers are actually pretty dumb. </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Important to Remember</h3>
            <p class="copy--small box">One of the most important things to remember is that when programming, you are doing something for people, and that the computer and the program mediate that. </p>

            <h3>Computers are Dumb</h3>
            <ul class="copy--small box--small list--tall">
                <li>Computers can only do what they have instructions for-- and they take those instructions VERY literally.</li>
                <li>As a result, you have to tell them every single thing you want them to do and every single thing to take into consideration. </li>
                <li>If you leave any instructions out (or put them in the “wrong” order), the results might not be what you expect.</li>
            </ul>

                            <li>One person is the "program", and one person is the "computer".</li>
                            <li>The "computer" has to do literally what the "program" says to do!</li>
                            <li>We did one person (program) telling the other person (computer) what to do verbatim (answering the phone)</li>

            <h3>Memory</h3>
            <p class="copy--small box">A computer doesn't have a memory like we do.</p>
            <p class="copy--xsmall box">Sure, a computer has "memory"-- In fact it has a few different kinds...</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Kinds of Memory - ROM</h3>
            <ul class="list--tall copy--small box--small">
                <li><b>ROM</b> or <b>Read-only memory</b> is the more permanent kind.</li>
                <li>ROM is used in the computer so that the processor does not have to look for important pieces of data when switched on, like the operating system.</li>
                <li>For the most part, you cannot edit files in ROM and data on it cannot be erased by turning off your computer.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Kinds of Memory -<br /> Hard-Disk Storage</h3>
            <ul class="list--tall copy--small box--small">
                <li>More permanent, more long term memory.</li>
                <li>This memory is what the computer uses to store programs and files that you create.</li>
                <li>Examples would be the hard drive on the computer, thumb drive, or external hard drive.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Kinds of Memory - RAM</h3>
            <ul class="list--tall copy--small box--small">
                <li><b>RAM</b> or <b>Random-access memory</b> is less permanent.</li>
                <li>RAM is the memory that the computer uses to do its "thinking" (such as when you're working on a Word document, the changes you make before you hit Save, are stored in RAM).</li>
                <li>It holds raw data waiting to be processed as well as the program instructions for processing that data</li>
                <li>It holds the results of processing until they can be stored more permanently on disk or tape </li>
                <li>When computer is turned off, data in RAM is gone and cannot be recovered unless it has been saved.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How does Ram Work?</h3>
            <ul class="list--tall copy--small box--small">
                <li>Microscopic parts called capacitors hold bits that represent data as 1s and 0s</li>
                <li>A RAM address helps locate data as needed for processing</li>
                <li>RAM is volatile which means it requires electrical power to hold data</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Difference between RAM and Hard-Disk Storage?</h4>
            <ul class="list--tall copy--small box--small">
                <li> RAM is temporary storage</li>
                <li> Hard-disk storage is more permanent </li>
                <li> RAM has less storage capacity </li>

            <h3>Variables</h3>
            <ul class="list--tall copy--small box--small">
                <li>A <span class="green">variable</span> is essentially a <strong>storage container for information</strong>.</li>
                <li>
                    Examples:
                    <ul class="copy--small">
                        <li>age = 28</li>

            <h3>Integer Variables</h3>
            <p class="copy--small box">Integer variables are used to store<br />positive or negative <strong>whole numbers</strong>.</p>
            <p class="copy--small box"><span class="blue">int bookCount=2</span></p>
            <ul class="list--tall copy--xsmall">
                <li><strong>Amazon Example:</strong> number of books you can order is an integer (also the number in 'cart').</li>
                <li>Amazon stores this field as an integer because they’ll want to do calculations with it. If you order 2 copies of a book, the program multiplies the price by 2 to get the total cost.</li>
                <li>However, this must always be a whole number (you cannot order 2.5 books).</li>
            </ul>

        <section>
            <h3>Floating Point Variables</h3>

            <ul class="list--tall copy--xsmall">
                <li><strong>Amazon Example:</strong> the price of the book you are purchasing ($9.95).</li>
                <li>Amazon stores this field as an floating point because they’ll want to do calculations with it. If you order 2 copies of a book, the program multiplies $9.95 by 2 to get the total cost.</li>

            <h3>String Variables</h3>
            <p class="copy--small box">String variables are used to store text.</p>

            <ul class="list--tall copy--xsmall">
                <li><strong>Amazon Example:</strong> if you went into your profile, fields like name, address, state, and city are strings.</li>
                <li>Usually when a string is created in the program, it's surrounded by quotation marks.</li>

                <li>
                    If you store a number as a string variable, you can't use it in any math calculations.
                    <ul class="copy--small">
                        <li>For example, credit card numbers are integers but you would never use them in a mathematical calculation.</li>
                        <li>Another example would be postal codes. Even though the USA uses only numbers, not all countries do. So if you make your zip code field an integer, no other country can use it except the USA.</li>

            <h3>Why Use Loops?</h3>
            <ul class="copy--small box--small list--tall">
                <li>Loops are very powerful. One primary reasons to use loops is to reduce your lines of code.</li>
                <li>Depending on what you're doing, you could have hundreds of lines of code using <code>if/then/else</code>, or you could write a simple loop statement.</li>

            <ul class="copy--small list--tall box--small">
                <li>An <span class="red">infinite loop</span> is a loop that will never meet the condition to stop. It will keep going until it's used up all your computer's (or server's) memory (RAM). This is bad!</li>
                <li>
                    Example for our loop:
                    <ul class="copy--small">
                        <li>If the <code>papers_to_deliver = papers_to_deliver - 1</code> line was missing, it would keep looping because 5 is always greater than 0!</li>
                        <li>If <code>papers_to_deliver = papers_to_deliver - 1</code> was changed to <code>+ 1</code>, it would keep adding 1 to papersToDeliver forever!</li>
                    </ul>
